# Root Certification Authority with OpenSSL

## Test a TLS webserver with a web browser

We have installed the CAâ€™s (Certificate Authority) certificate on the web browser. Then, we add to this browser the `cacert.pem` file. Once this is done, we can test the certificate by trying to access the node server we just run previously.

We can see that the certificate is valid, however we can see that the issuer is not trusted by the browser:

If we revoke the webserver's certificate by running:

```source 
kali@ca:$ openssl ca -config openssl.cnf revoke certs/webserver.crt.pem
```

As the certificate has been revoked, when we go to the browser, it should display an error
message with the code `SEC_ERROR_REVOKED_CERTIFICATE`.

## Authenticate the webserver using a client interface

Let's force the node server to ask for client authentication. We can do this by changing the `htppsOptions` in the code we already had:

```javascript
const httpsOptions = {
    key: tlsServerKey,
    cert: tlsServerCrt
    cert: tlsServerCrt,
    requestCert: true,
    ca: caCert
};

const caCert = fs.readFleSync('./tls/cacert.pem')
```

Then, issue a new certificate for the webserver, as we revoked the one we had before:

```source
kali@webserver:$ openssl req -new -addext 'subjectAltName = IP:10.0.2.15' -nodes -keyout tls/webserver.key.pem -out webserver.csr.pem  
```

Generate a certificate for the client in the root CA, making sure it has the `usr_cert` extensions:

```source
kali@ca:$ openssl req -new -keyout private/testtlsserver.key.pem -out requests/testtlsserver.csr.pem
kali@ca:% openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -extensions usr_cert -in requests/testtlsserver.csr.pem -out certs/testtlsserver.crt.pem
```

After, we generate a PKCS #12 file containing the client certificate and private key using the `openssl pkcs12` command:

```source
openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey private/testtlsserver.key.pem -in certs/testtlsserver.crt.pem -out private/testtlsserver.pfx
```

Now, we import the PKCS #12 file into the browser certificates selecting `clients.pfx`. Then, we can test the certificate by trying to access the node server we just run previously.
